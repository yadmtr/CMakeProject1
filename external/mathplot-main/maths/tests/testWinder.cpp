 * Winder code should be able to compute the winding number of a coordinate with
 * respect to a container of coordinates which trace out a path. The coordinate used
 * for the Winder class could be std::array<float, 2> or std::vector<double>. It could
 * be pair<float, float> or BezCoord<float>. Let's test a few
 * possibilities. There's some function specialization in sm::winder which makes
 * all this possible.
